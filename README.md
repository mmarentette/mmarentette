## Hello, GitHub!
# I'm Melissa Marentette 👋🏻 👩🏻‍💻


I am a Software Engineer with a passion for energy conservation, home renovations and travel. I am a lifelong learner with the drive to continually expand my repertoire of programming languages, technologies, and frameworks.

Throughout my five-year career at Enbridge, I managed multiple energy conservation programs for both the residential and commercial sectors. When I was leading our Smart Thermostat Program, I oversaw the design and launch of an online application that validated customer eligibility and issued unique discount codes compatible with participating retailer POS systems. This project helped me realize how much I enjoy development work - from ideation to testing to deployment.

I am eager to bring my logical reasoning, teamwork and adaptability to companies that build technologies to support a more sustainable future.
